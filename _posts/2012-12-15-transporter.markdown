_Designed and built nature-inspired toys as part of an introductory design and mechanical prototyping class at Olin._
Design Nature is a required class for first year students at Olin and provides an introduction to design and mechanical prototyping. The first half of the class is a solo project, where each student designs a hopping toy inspired by nature and subject to certain restrictions. For me, the project represented my first foray into motion simulations as part of the design process. While I was new to mechanical design and my hopper was not extraordinary, I was pleased that the simulation provided a very accurate jump height prediction.

The second half of the class is a group project with the end goal of producing a toy, also inspired by nature, which transports something and is fun for ten year olds. My group was assigned to make a camel, which is altogether a very silly animal. We did make a cute toy that swayed when it walked like a camel does, but most of what I learned through that project was about team dynamics.
