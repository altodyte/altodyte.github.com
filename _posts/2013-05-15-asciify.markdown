_Created a suite of programs for converting video to ASCII art video, including live webcam imagery._

As a final project for a software design class at Olin, my team built several different applications which converted video into ASCII art representations of those videos. Our final products were capable of rapidly converting a variety of video file types (as long as feature length films) into ASCII art with complexity ranging from pseudo-grayscale using relative apparent pixel densities of different characters to edge detection and matching using advanced image processing and a dedicated edge character set. My primary contributions were to the underlying greyscale ASCII-art conversion used in all the applications and to all layers of the live webcam ASCII art, as well as some of the mathematics for the fast edge-detection approach.
