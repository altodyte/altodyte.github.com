_Developed localizing algorithms, contributed to software implementation, and tuned an acoustic touch screen._

As a member of a team of five Oliners, I helped design and build an acoustic touch screen using piezoelectric vibration sensors. The raw sensor data was first processed by a bank of active and passive electronic filters to minimize non-signal noise. After that, the waveforms fed to an Arduinoâ€™s DAC GPIO pins and the site of a tap on the glass touch screen surface was established by a trigger-and-triangulate algorithm inspired by the systems used by seismograph or telecom networks to locate earthquake epicenters and cell phones respectively. My primary contribution to the project was developing this triangulation method and writing code to implement and tune it.
