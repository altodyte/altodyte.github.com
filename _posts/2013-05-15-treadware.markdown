_Product design and rough business modeling of a smart shoe insert enabling richer data-driven athletic training._

Treadware was the "company" that my team created for an Olin entrepreneurship class. Our flagship product was the [Piez][piez-video-link], a smart bluetooth-connected shoe insert which enabled athletes and their coaches or trainers to obtain rich foot-strike and weight distribution data. We did user research and proof-of-concept testing to ensure that we could collect data, and that the data our product could collect would be useful to the training process. Several months after we set the project aside to continue our studies, similar products began showing up on Kickstarter, which we took as a flattering kind of validation in our semester's work.
