_Introductory execution of fundamental robotics concepts and methods for sensing, thinking, and acting using a tricked-out model tugboat._

This was my final class project for the introductory robotics course at Olin. We were introduced to paradigms of behavior-based robotics, runtime-layered hierarchies, as well as other robotic brain architectures.
